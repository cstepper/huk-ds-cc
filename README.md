## Motor third-part liability

#### Modeling expected amount of damage"

Two datasets [freMTPL2freq](https://www.openml.org/d/41214) and
[freMTPL2sev](https://www.openml.org/d/41215) contain risk features and claims
(numbers and amounts) for motor third-part liability policies in France.

The *task* is to model the *expected amount of damage per policy holder and
year*, using a set of risk features.
